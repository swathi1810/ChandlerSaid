Me being an ardent fan of [FRIENDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends) & [Chandler Bing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Bing) (well, who isn't?) on one fine day, wanted to create twitter account that could keep tweeting every single line that [Chandler Bing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Bing)  spoke on the show.

[This Twitter Handle](https://twitter.com/BingItDown) ![alt text][1.2] keeps tweeting once every 10 minutes with a random line of Chandler Bing. 

Forever, if time coudl persist.
